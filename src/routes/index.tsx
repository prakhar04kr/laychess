    title: "Born in 6th-century India",
    body: "Chess descends from chaturanga, a four-player war game played in Gupta-era India around 600 CE. It traveled to Persia as shatranj, where the cry shāh māt — “the king is helpless” — became today’s checkmate.",
  },
  {
    title: "The longest legal game",
    body: "Under the 50-move and threefold-repetition rules, the theoretical maximum length of a chess game is 5,898 moves. The longest tournament game ever played lasted 269 moves — Nikolić vs Arsović, Belgrade 1989 — and ended in a draw.",
  },
  {
    title: "More positions than atoms in the visible universe",
    body: "The Shannon number estimates the game-tree complexity of chess at roughly 10¹²⁰ — vastly more than the ~10⁸⁰ atoms estimated in the observable universe. That is why brute-force search alone cannot solve chess.",
  },
  {
    title: "The first move advantage",
    body: "Across millions of master games, White scores about 54–56%. The pull of the first move is small but real, and it shapes opening theory at the very top level.",
  },
  {
    title: "Deep Blue, 1997",
    body: "IBM’s Deep Blue beat reigning world champion Garry Kasparov 3½–2½ in a six-game match — the first time a computer defeated a world champion under standard time controls. Modern engines now eclipse Deep Blue by hundreds of Elo.",
  },
  {
    title: "The fastest checkmate",
    body: "Fool’s Mate ends the game in two moves: 1.f3 e5 2.g4 Qh4#. It only works if White cooperates — but it shows how quickly a king without defenders can fall.",
  },
  {
    title: "Castling is the only two-piece move",
    body: "Castling is the single move in chess where two of your own pieces move at once. It also encodes a hidden cost: once you forfeit the right, you cannot get it back.",
  },
  {
    title: "Zugzwang — the duty to move",
    body: "From German for “compulsion to move,” zugzwang describes a position where any move worsens your stance. Endgames are full of it; engines hunt for it like a scent.",
